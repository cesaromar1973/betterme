          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>1. Who is this supplement designed for?</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align:left">Better Cells is designed for any adult who wants to help boost their body&rsquo;s natural defenses and strengthen their overall Cell Health.*</p>
          <p style="text-align:left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>2. What is Cell Health?</strong></p>
          <p>Cell Health describes the overall sate of our cells, which determines the overall state of our bodies. Better Cells addresses Cell Health by supplying ample doses of complementary antioxidants and other vitamins and minerals that work at the cellular level. Zinc, for example, is required for the function of hundreds of enzymes that are constantly at work inside our cells.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>3. How do the&nbsp;antioxidants in Better Cells&nbsp;work?</strong></p>
          <p>Better Cells works mainly by supplying the body&nbsp;with antioxidants. Antioxidants boost Cell Health and overall body defense by neutralizing harmful molecules called free radicals.*</p>
          <p>Free radicals are unstable molecules that can interact with cellular structures, steal their electrons and damage or even kill cells. Antioxidants like vitamins A, C and E&nbsp;can give electrons to free radicals, neutralizing them before they can cause cellular damage.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>4. Where do free radicals come from?</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align:left">Free radicals are produced when the body is exposed to various types of radiation, including UV rays from the sun. They also come from common sources of pollution like cigarette smoke and car exhaust. Free radicals are also constantly being produced by normal bodily functions. Because free radicals are so prevalent in and around our bodies, regular antioxidant intake is an important part of maintaining good Cell Health.</p>
          <p style="text-align:left">&nbsp;</p>
          <p style="text-align:left"><strong>5. Are there any visible signs of good or bad Cell Health?</strong></p>
          <p style="text-align:left">Skin aging is a visible process that can be traced back to Cell Health. Premature skin aging can be caused by excessive free radical damage, often from UV rays. If you notice that your skin is aging more quickly than expected, taking an antioxidant focused supplement like Better Cells may be beneficial.*</p>
